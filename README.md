# Memory Game

## Setup and Development

    npm i
    npm run dev

## Technologies

- React.js as UI framework.
- MobX for state management. 
- Typescript.
- Emotion.js for styling.
- Parcel.js as bundler. 

## Choices

I prefer MobX to Redux for its simplicity.
Parcel.js works out of the box, without any configuration needed.
I decided to use Typescript to support type checking.

I understand my choices don't necessarily work for more complex applications, 
but I've decided to go for speed and simplicity for this project.

## What's missing

- The game could be extended with more functionalities:
    - A timer
    - Scoring
    - Playing against a bot
    - Choose the board size
    - ...
- Unit/Functional/UI tests!
